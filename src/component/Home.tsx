          Over the past four years, I've been fortunate to design and refine
          digital products across tech, e-commerce, and finance industries. My
          approach is rooted in simplicity and a holistic perspectiveâ€”breaking
          down complex problems into intuitive, user-centered solutions,{" "}
          <span className="opacity-50">
            while never losing sight of the finer details that truly elevate a
            design. When I'm not crafting seamless digital experiences, you'll
            find me exploring my love for interior design and cars, or diving
            into the world of movies and shows for a fresh dose of inspiration.
